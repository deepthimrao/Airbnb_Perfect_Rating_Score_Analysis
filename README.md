# Airbnb Perfect Rating Score Analysis
The project focused on predicting the likelihood of an Airbnb listing receiving a perfect rating
score. Airbnb.com is a widely recognized home-sharing platform that connects homeowners with
renters worldwide. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we aimed to determine whether a
listing would achieve a 100% perfect rating score or not.
To achieve our objectives, our team aimed to generate binary predictions with a high True
Positive Rate (TPR) while keeping the False Positive Rate (FPR) below 10%. This approach
allowed us to effectively identify listings with perfect rating scores while minimizing false
positives.

The dataset provided for analysis included a range of informative columns, such as property
access, accommodation details, amenities, availability metrics, cancellation policies, location
information, pricing, and textual descriptions. These attributes offered valuable insights into the
factors influencing perfect rating scores.
Throughout the project, we applied advanced data mining techniques and utilized feature
engineering to enhance the performance of our predictive models. By leveraging machine
learning algorithms, we evaluated multiple models to determine their accuracy in predicting
perfect rating scores. Our primary goal was to identify the most effective model for this specific
task.

After conducting comprehensive testing and analysis, we identified that the Ranger model
exhibited the highest accuracy in predicting the success of Airbnb listings in terms of achieving a
perfect rating score. The Ranger algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance and delivered
precise predictions.
Our predictive model incorporated a variety of features, including availability metrics, property
details, host-related information, cancellation policies, and other relevant attributes. These
4
factors played a significant role in determining the probability of a listing receiving a perfect
rating score.

The Ranger model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 76.79% on the test set with a TPR of
~42% and an FPR of ~8.6%, providing valuable insights into the factors that contribute to perfect
rating scores on Airbnb.com. By adjusting the identified variables, our model offers hosts the
opportunity to enhance their chances of achieving a perfect rating score. This, in turn, improves
the overall guest experience and increases the potential for attracting more renters.
In conclusion, our data mining project successfully addressed the challenge of predicting perfect
rating scores for Airbnb listings. By utilizing the Ranger model and incorporating key attributes,
we achieved a high accuracy rate. Our findings and recommendations can be instrumental in
assisting hosts to optimize their listings and provide exceptional experiences to Airbnb guests.
